# Localization!!!
Contributions for localization are welcome! Feel free to open a pull request or open an issue report with contributions.  Please do not open an issue report asking for a localization without giving the necessary translations as the authors cannot translate to languages other than those already supported!

# Notes
Classic support: Classic (and Classic TBC) are not supported. It might work, but it probably won't. Contributions to add support are welcome.

New in version 4: Loggerhead dynamically builds dungeon and raid information instead of relying on external libraries. What this means is that your configuration menu will *ONLY* show instances and difficulties that you have discovered/entered. Better yet, it also means that LoggerHead will work with new dungeons and raids without having to be updated!!!
